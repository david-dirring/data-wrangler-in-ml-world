        "I have been working on a really fun binary classification model at work.  We have a training process that runs weekly, but our batch prediction process (let's call it \"test-time inference\" process like Rachel Thomas does [here](https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/)) runs multiple times per day.  Much of the feature data changes intraday, **so I have to be sure that the test-time inference data that we feed into our weekly trained model (a pickle file) has the same charateristics as the data that it trained on.**  I have developed a script in BigQuery to use [BQML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference) that runs every time my test-time inference process runs to check that my \"training\" data looks similar enough to my \"test-time inference\" data."

What we don't learn about is how you should SAVE down that model file somewhere so that your \"test-inference\" process can pick it up later. We use GCP at work to store the files, so we save it down to a Google Cloud Storage bucket (equivalent of S3 at AWS)."
