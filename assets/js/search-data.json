I have been wranging data, data storytelling, and helping internal customers understand their area for 13+ years. In the last 3 years, I began teaching myself data science and machine learning. I am very lucky that I get to work on fun ML projects at work. My tools of choice are – BigQuery (or any SQL), Tableau, Python, and Powerpoint. . I want to use this blog to help document my machine learning journey so that I can help others while also helping to solidify learnings and thoughts of my own. .",
